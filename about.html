   <p>Etty Grossman is a University of Miami student who was born and raise in Colombia. She decided to study in the U.S. because she knew it would provide her other opportunities she wouldn't have in Colombia.</p>

   <p>She is a journalism major with a minor in public relations, and this website is the result of one of her journalism courses (JMM 341).</p>

   <p>The idea of the final project was to create an explanatory journalism website. Each student had the opportunity to choose their topic of preference. In Etty’s case, she decided to go with gentrification because she is very passionate about social issues, arts, and culture.</p>

   <p>Gentrification is a very large concept that’s why she narrowed it to Miami and more specifically Wynwood; a neighborhood where the process of gentrification was radically different from other places like SoHo. Here a process that takes decades occurred within years and it wasn’t led by artist, as it usually is.</p>

   <p>Etty hopes that by reading her website, people can understand that gentrification isn’t always a negative process.</p>

   <p>“Wynwood can become something great,” she says. “Developers don’t have to stop doing what they are doing, they just have to start doing what they aren’t: thinking about locals.”</p>
