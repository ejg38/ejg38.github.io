    <p>Developers play a very important role in the gentrification process. Usually, they are the pioneer individuals that see potential in inexpensive yet architecturally desirable urban areas and also who buy and renovate these properties either for their own personal use or to promote the growth of a field; in the case of Wynwood, arts and culture.</p>

    <p>At the beginning, very little displacement occurs since the pioneer gentrifiers obtain properties that are part of the normal market turnover. The big change occurs when the media diverts attention onto the neighborhood turning it into a hub of interest for investors, designers, and artists.</p>

    <p>This lead to a growing demand for houses and non-residential buildings in the area, a situation that contributes to the ever increasing house, rent prices, and displacement.</p>

    <p>These are the main developers that were and are currently involved with the gentrification process in Wynwood.</p>

    <h2>Goldman Properties</h2>
      <p>Until his death in 2012, Tony Goldman a late modern American developer, spent most of a decade watching people, smiling at the developing arts and culture. He was joined by his daughter, Jessica Srebnick, who also believed in the possibility of turning ordinary walls into a huge canvas.</p>

      <p>Goldman Properties’ vision for Wynwood is to add life to lifeless buildings, color and presence to bland facades, activate abandoned streets, and create a community where individuals of all backgrounds and demographics could live, participate and enjoy the arts. </p>

    <h2>Lombardi Properties</h2>
      <p>“In 2000 when I first came to Wynwood I liked the scale of the buildings and the width of the streets,” said David Lombardi, broker and founder of Lombardi Properties, one of the biggest boutique realty firms in Miami.</p>

      <p>“Reality is; the area was not inviting but I saw that amazing things could be done with the spaces so I started getting involved with artists.”</p>

      <p>This understanding of Wynwood’s potential to become the place where Miami’s creatives clouds could live led him to begin buying property in the area and relocate his office to the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>As an avid art collector, he has created interesting spaces that attract diverse groups of people to enjoy Wynwood.</p>

        <p>It started with the vision of transforming Wynwood into an international culture hub for the Americas, however, within the past few years the operation expanded to include the arts community.</p>

      <p>To ensure a high-quality life of Wynwood’s future residents, which realtors believe would be wealthy artists and entrepreneurs between ages 25 and 35; top urban developers such as Goldman Properties, MANA Wynwood, and Lombardi Properties, are currently working on many different projects. The renovation and rehabilitation of most of the properties in Wynwood and Downtown Miami to attract and retain talent locally; an eight-story parking garage with commercial and office components to solve Wynwood’s parking issue; and a micro retail project with some office space available are just a few examples.</p>
