  <p id="p1">Back in the 1930s with South Beach’s architectural Art Deco revolution, Miami stopped being grandmas and shopper’s destination to become the American Riviera. However, the whole city momentum came by the 2000s when Wynwood, located just a few blocks from north Downtown, catch the eye of developers who initiated the gentrification process.</p>

  <p>Originally spelled Wyndwood, was not always a major attraction. Since its inception, the neighborhood was an area for working class families. By the middle 1950s, it began to be filled with Puerto Ricans attracted by the opportunities to improve their economics. As the district got more popular, the value of commercial square footage went up and many of the manufacturers decided to move out to places like Hialeah. Unemployment and abandonment made the place unsafe and served as the perfect scenario for drug trafficking and crime. While residents challenged the county for more security measurements, the artistic initiative also started to take place.</p>

  <p>In 2002 Art Basel, a platform for galleries to show and sell their work debuted in Miami Beach. With this improvement, people interested in arts and culture thought about Miami as the perfect destination.</p>

  <p>In 2006 Goldman Properties, a force behind the revival of SoHo and South Beach began buying up chunks of Wynwood warehouse district. Lombardi Properties and other top developers like Dezer Development, LeFrak, Comras Company, among others, did the same.</p>

  <p>Since that year, Wynwood has become something unique. There more than 70 galleries, collections, restaurants, cafes, chic shopping stores, museums and more. But while tourists, art lovers, foodies and hipsters enjoy the attractions, there are others who aren’t pleased with Wynwood’s gentrification.</p>

  <p>“As an artist and gallery owner people would think that I’m in love with what developers are doing with the neighborhood, but I’m not,” said Venezuelan artist Nahila Campos. “It might be becoming more profitable for businesses, but at the artist and community level, it has been lost.”</p>

  <p>Artists feel that their works aren’t being appreciated and they believe that developers are using art just as a marketing tool to attract people. However, although gentrification is often used negatively, suggesting the displacement of poor communities by rich outsiders, its real impact varies.</p>
