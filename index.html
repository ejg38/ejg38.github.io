  <p>College in Miami might sound appealing to many people, but for me it was more of a personal challenge. I was born and raised in Colombia, so English is not my first language. However, I learned English in high school and practiced it at home by watching tutorials.</p>

  <p>I wanted to study in the U.S. because I knew it would provide me other  opportunities I wouldn't have in Colombia. Besides, I would get the chance to meet new people from all over the world.</p>

  <p>I decided to study journalism so I can learn new techniques and hopefully  go back to my home country and change the way news are being written. If having my own Colombian newspaper doesn't go well,  I would love to be a magazine editor.</p>
